# Operations research

**Operations research (OR)** is a branch of applied mathematics that aims to develop analytical methods to **support decision making.**

> [!important]
> The goal here is to find the **optimal** solution of a particular problem. Examples are the maximum (minimum) profit (cost), or the optimal way to organize triage.

OR tackles a wide range of problems, hence the need to use tools from other areas (CS, Finance,  Statistics). Applications:
- Optimising supply chains & logistics
- Improving production processes
- Maximise profit & minimise cost
## Brief history

Modern operational research rose during the WWII, when it was crucial to make strategical decisions with the support of analytical reasoning.
