# Zettelkasten

A new method to deal with knowledge in my life. 

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a **web of thought** possible. It emphasizes connection over collection. 

This method of organizing knowledge helps you increase knowledge and makes you a better *Observer*. You start to see connections between pieces of knowledge you have written or read, and some may lead you to unthinkable paths.
## TL; DR
A well-made Zettelkasten amplifies effectiveness of note-taking in **many ways**:
 1. The hyper-textual nature of Zettelkasten allows ideas to be easily connected to one another.
 2. Decreases friction when taking notes , so it's easier to jot down and to persist knowledge.
 3. Knowledge for future projects is prepared. 
 4. A bigger topic is divided into small and maintainable islands of knowledge. After that, you can take a step back and look at the whole picture.
 5. Allows us to follow a specific line of thought for a longer time.

## Traits

### Hyper-links

Zettelkasten emphasizes on **making connections** over creating standalone notes. The latter is *linear*, the former is *organic*.

>A single note is called *Zettel*, and it's the smallest building block of the Zettelkasten.

Every Zettel is uniquely identified by an address, which can be used to make connections between Zettels. This connection is called **hyper-link**. 

### Principle of Atomicity

Each Zettel contains one unit of knowledge. Knowledge is indeed divided into small and manageable units of knowledge, that cannot be further divided.

>A *Thought* should represent the base unit of Zettelkasten. Thoughts should have well-defined boundaries between each other. 
>
>**One Zettel per thought**.
### Personal

Zettelkasten is a *personal* knowledge tool. You should only write for yourself.

## Anatomy of a Zettel

>A single base of knowledge is called *Zettel*, and it's the smallest building block of a Zettelkasten.

Each Zettel is made of three components
- Unique identifier
- Body
- References

The **identifier** in mandatory to create a Zettelkasten. Without an identifier, a *Zettel* will drown in the sea of knowledge. As long as it is unique, the title of the note can be used as the identifier.

The **body** of a *Zettel* contains the knowledge. A key aspect of the content of a *Zettel* is that is **must  be written in your own words**. 

>Copy-Paste is not allowed.
>The act of *thinking* and *formulating* a thought based on some resource is the correct way to make knowledge persistent in your brain.
